      <description>Overview Koi stealer samples began appearing on any.run in mid-late february. The samples identified as Koi are mostly Powershell scripts, including the one I analysed.&#xA;Note: Koi stealer should not be confused with AZORult. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve identified, they are two distinct families, and not even written in the same language. Koi is written in C# while AZORult 2019 is written in C++.&#xA;The stealer performs basic system checks before stealing various data in 3 stages - browser data, including passwords, cryptocurrency wallet and password manager data, some application data, and other files of interest.</description>

      <description>Reverse engineering software is a lot of work. Personally, the hardest part is figuring out which areas are worth examining further. Looking in the wrong places can cause you to miss valuable information.&#xA;One construct that can trip people up is struct representation in assembly. It can be unclear when a struct is being manipulated or accessed. After all, the struct is organised as a contiguous block of bytes, with each member residing sequentially in memory.</description>
