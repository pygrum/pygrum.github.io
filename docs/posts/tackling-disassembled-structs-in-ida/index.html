<p>One construct that can trip people up is struct representation in assembly. It can be unclear when a struct is being manipulated or accessed. After all, the struct is organised as a contiguous block of bytes, with each member residing sequentially in memory. Remembering this can actually be helpful to us.</p>
<p><img src="images/example-struct.png" alt="example">
<em>A look at how an example struct resides in memory</em></p>
<p>When we find code that seems to access random offsets in memory, that&rsquo;s a good sign that a struct is being used. It is then up to us to figure out the dimensions of each field, and what they are being used for. Thankfully, it&rsquo;s easy to gain some practice doing this - by writing and disassembling our own code! We&rsquo;ll use the struct shown in the figure above in the program that we&rsquo;re going to reverse ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="starting-from-scratch">Starting From Scratch</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by writing a small C program that uses structs to store information. Afterwards, compile it and open the binary up in IDA to see what it looks like.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of what the program does if you&rsquo;re not familiar with C:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entrypoint is main. We initialise an empty <code>pii</code> struct, a type that we declared at the top of the file, containing fields of static length (10, 4, 17)</li>
<li>We then pass that empty struct address to the <code>init_pii</code> function, which assigns values to each field</li>
<li>Finally, we print the values that were assigned by <code>init_pii</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that your binary won&rsquo;t contain the typedefs you declare, which is why we&rsquo;re tackling this issue in the first place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll compile this program (using <code>gcc</code> on Linux) and open it up in IDA.</p>
<h2 id="surgical">Surgical</h2>
<p><img src="images/ida-view-main.png" alt="main-ida"></p>
<p>This looks like a lot. But remember to focus on the important parts.<br>
We&rsquo;ll pretend that we are unaware of any struct declarations in this program. We&rsquo;ll go through the process of deducing these ourselves.</p>
<p>One thing shown here that can be confusing is the declaration of multiple variables for what we know is one struct. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fatal to assume these were separate variables initially.<br>
Another thing you may have noticed is the compile-time assertions that do stack safety checks. We can ignore those (they&rsquo;re just extra noise). Let&rsquo;s dive into the <code>init_pii</code> function early - we know that it&rsquo;s responsible for something important, because the program starts accessing values right after it has been called (this is the type of thought process we need to develop).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to mention that we usually won&rsquo;t have function names. For a more realistic scenario, strip the symbol table with <code>gcc</code>&rsquo;s <code>-s</code> option.</p>
<p><img src="images/init_pii.png" alt="init-pii"><br>
<em>Disassembly of init_pii</em></p>
<p>Looks pretty complicated. Our <code>strcpy</code> calls were inlined too, which doesn&rsquo;t help at all! This is where the IDA decompiler / pseudocode view can help. It can actually recognise operations like <code>strcpy</code> and represent them in the pseudocode view.</p>
<p><img src="images/pseudo-init-pii.png" alt="init-pii-pseudo"><br>
<em>Pseudocode representation of init_pii</em></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that helpful? Granted, it didn&rsquo;t expand <em>everything</em>. But hopefully, we can work with what we have now.</p>
<h2 id="creating-our-structure">Creating our structure</h2>
<p><code>init_pii</code> almost looks like a serialisation routine, as it seems to be manipulating variable offsets. This is another telling sign of struct manipulation. We can see that (a1 + 12) to (a1 + 16) is where &lsquo;20&rsquo; is assigned (<code>age</code>, if you remember). We also see that the PAN is copied to a1 + 16 and onwards. We can use these details to start defining our custom struct in IDA.</p>
<p>Open the structure subview and press the <code>Insert</code> key (or, right-click and press &lsquo;Add struct type&rsquo;).</p>
<p><img src="images/struct-create.png" alt="creation"><br>
<em>Give your struct a name, I&rsquo;ve named it personal_info</em></p>
<p>While the struct is highlighted, press the <code>A</code> key to add a new string field for our &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; offset of a1 to (a1 + 11) (inclusive). We give it an array size of 12. Next, while <code>ends</code> is highlighted, add the <code>DWORD</code> &lsquo;age&rsquo; field by pressing the <code>D</code> key and cycling through the data types (by repeatedly pressing <code>D</code> while the new field is highlighted) until we get to <code>dd</code>, aka &lsquo;define double word&rsquo; (<code>DWORD</code>). Finally, highlighting <code>ends</code> again, add another string of size 17 to represent the PAN that was assigned by pressing <code>A</code>. Name your struct fields by pressing <code>N</code> while they are highlighted.</p>
<p>Your struct should end up looking something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/struct.png" alt="final"></p>
<p>Now we can convert a1 by right-clicking -&gt; &lsquo;convert to struct*&rsquo;, and selecting the struct you defined.</p>
<p><img src="images/readable.png" alt="readable"></p>
<p>Much better. Now although we still see unknown as a number, we can try to convert it to character representation by highlighting the number and pressing <code>R</code>. We know to do this because before the call to <code>printf</code>, a1 / <code>var_30</code> is passed to <code>rsi</code>, which is printed in string format. Although it usually isn&rsquo;t this easy to figure out, getting clues from the context and usage of offsets is equally as important.</p>
<p><img src="images/bob.png" alt="bob"></p>
<p>Now, select <code>var_30</code> (or whatever variable is used as the struct) and hit <code>Ctrl+K</code> to open it in the stack frame view. Right-click and select &lsquo;struct var&rsquo;, then choose the struct you defined. Now go back to the main function view, and hit F5 (or <code>Fn+F5</code>) to view <code>main</code> as pseudocode.</p>
<p><img src="images/main-deobf.png" alt="main"></p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s (almost) completely readable!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this post taught you a thing or two about deobfuscating disassembled code to make the reverse engineering process easier. These techniques are easily applied to malware analysis, vulnerability research, or any sort of tampering.</p>
